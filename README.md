Below is a sample `README.md` for your Ansible OpenVPN project. This README provides an overview of the project, prerequisites, installation instructions, and usage guidance. You should customize the content to fit your specific project details and requirements.

# Ansible OpenVPN Setup

This project automates the deployment of an OpenVPN server on a Debian-based system using Ansible. It also configures client machines by generating the necessary client configuration files and certificates.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Ansible 2.9 or higher installed on your local machine or a control node.
- A Debian-based server for the OpenVPN server.
- Root or sudo access on the target server.
- The target server's IP address or hostname defined in your Ansible inventory.

## Configuration
1. **Inventory:** Define your servers in the `inventory/all.yml` file.
2. **Group Variables:** Set common variables in `group_vars/all.yml`.
3. **Host Variables:** Define host-specific variables in `host_vars/vpn-server1.yml` and `host_vars/vpn-server2.yml`.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone this repository to your local machine or control node.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ansible-openvpn.git
   ```

2. **Configure Ansible Inventory**

   Add your server's IP address or hostname to the Ansible inventory file. You can add it to the existing `/etc/ansible/hosts` file or create a custom inventory file for this project.

   ```ini
   [openvpn_server]
   your_server_ip
   ```

3. **Set Up Variables**

   Review and customize the variables in the `roles/openvpn_server/vars/main.yml` and `roles/openvpn_client/vars/main.yml` files to match your deployment needs.

4. **Run the Ansible Playbook**

   Navigate to the project directory and run the Ansible playbook.

   ```bash
   ansible-playbook -i inventory/all.yml playbooks/main.yml
   ```

## Usage

After running the playbook, your OpenVPN server will be up and running. The client configuration files (`.ovpn`) will be available on the server at `/etc/openvpn/client/`.

To use these configuration files:

1. Securely copy the `.ovpn` file from your server to your client machine.

   ```bash
   cp /etc/openvpn/client/clientname.ovpn /tmp/ 
   
   scp user@your_server_ip:/tmp/clientname.ovpn /path/to/client/config/
   ```

2. Use the OpenVPN client to import the `.ovpn` file and connect to the VPN.
